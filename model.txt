I live my life in the city
There's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me
I live my life for the stars that shine
People say it's just a waste of time
When they said I should feed my head
That to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
You're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you're concerned about the way I feel
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
I live my life in the city
There's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me
I live my life for the stars that shine
People say it's just a waste of time
When they said I should feed my head
Well, that to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
You're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you're concerned about the way I feel
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
You're not down with who I am
Look at you now, you're all in my hands
Tonight
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
I'd like to be somebody else and not know where I've been
I'd like to build myself a house out of plasticine
Shake along with me
I've been driving in my car with my friend Mr. Soft
Mr. Clean and Mr. Ben are living in my loft
Shake along with me!
I'm sorry but I just don't know I know
I said I told you so
But when you're happy and you're feeling fine
Then you'll know it's the right time
It's the right time
To shake along with me!
Mister Sifter sold me songs
when I was just sixteen
Now he stops at traffic lights
but only when they're green
Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone
Maybe I just wanna fly
Want to live I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever
I said, maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone
Maybe I will never be
All the things that I wanna be
Now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever
Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone
Maybe I just wanna fly
Want to live I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever
Gonna live forever [x6]
Hey you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly
Tell me how high
Do you think you'll go
Before you start falling
Hey you! Up in a tree
You wanna be me
But that couldn't be
Cos the people here they don't hear you calling
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
Hey you! wearing the crown
Making no sound
I heard you feel down
Well that's too bad
Welcome to my world
Hey you! Stealing the light
I heard that the shine's
Gone out of your life.
Well that's just too bad
Welcome to my world
You'll need assistance with the things that you have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
Before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
Hey you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly
Tell me how high Do you think you'll go
Before you start falling
Hey you! Up in a tree
You wanna be me
But that couldn't be
Cos the people here they don't hear you calling
How does it feel
When you're inside me?
You'll need assistance with the things that you have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
Before you've breathed it in
How does it feel

I need to be myself
I can't be no one else
I'm feeling supersonic
Give me gin and tonic
You can have it all but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your BMW ?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine
You need to find out
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow
'Cos my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call [2x]
You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else
I know a girl called Elsa
She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffin' in her tissue
Sellin' the Big Issue
When she finds out
No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow
'Cos my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call [2x]
What was that sound ringing around your brain?
Today was just a blur, you gotta head like a ghost train
What was that sound ringing around your brain?
You're here on your own who you gonna find to blame?
You're the outcast - you're the underclass
But you don't care - because you're living fast
You're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who
I'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight.
Bring it on down. Bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breath
You're the outcast - you're the underclass
But you don't care - because you're living fast
You're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who
I'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight.
Is it my imagination
Or have I finally found something worth living for?
I was looking for some action
But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol
You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
Cos when it comes on top . . .
You gotta make it happen!
Is it worth the aggravation
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?
It's a crazy situation
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol!
You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
Cos when it comes on top . . .
You gotta make it happen!
What a life it would be
If you would come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
And we'll have lasagne
I'll treat you like a Queen
I'll give you strawberries and cream
And then your friends will all go green
For my lasagne
These could be the best days of our lives
But I don't think we've been living very wise
Oh no! no!
What a life it would be
If you would come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
And we'll have lasagne
These could be the best days of our lives
But I don't think we've been living very wise
Oh no! no!
What a life it would be
If you would come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
And we'll have lasagne I'll treat you like a Queen
I'll give you strawberries and cream
And then your friends will all go green
For my lasagne
Slide away - and give it all you've got
My today - fell in from the top
I dream of you - and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now?
Hold me down - all the world's asleep
I need you now - you've knocked me off my feet
I dream of you - and we talk of growing old
But you said please don't!
Slide in baby - together we'll fly
I've tried praying - but I don't know what you're saying to me
Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning, we don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done
Let me be the one that shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Away
Slide away - give it all you've got
My today - fell in from the top
I dream of you - and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now?
Slide in baby - together we'll fly
I've tried praying - and I know just what you're saying to me
Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one who shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
We're two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done
Oh let me be the one, that shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there
Take me there
All I know is you can take me there
Take me there
Slide away
Slide away
There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye I'm going home
I hate the way that even though you
Know you're wrong you say you're right
I hate the books you read and all your friends
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night
Up all night
There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye I'm going home
I hate the way that you are so sarcastic
And you're not very bright
You think that everything you've done's fantastic
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night
Up all night
And it will be nice to be alone
For a week or two
But I know that I will be right
Right back here with you
With you...
There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye I'm going home
Sing a sad song
In a lonely place
Try to put a word in for me
It's been so long
Since I found this place
You better put in two or three
We as people, are just walking 'round
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
What we don't see
Well it can't be real
What we don't touch we cannot feel
Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong
So we don't ask why
Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day
If you need it
Something I can give
I know I'd help you if I can
If your honest and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand
Or a sad song
In a lonely place
I'll try to put a word in for you
Need a shoulder? well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do
Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
When we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong
So we don't ask why
Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day
I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cause the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello
There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
It's good to be back
You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take
Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I'm gonna take me away and hide
I'm thinking of things that I just can't abide
I know the roads down which your life will drive
I find the key that lets you slip inside
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door
But you know I think I recognize your face
But I've never seen you before
You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take
I know the roads down which your life will drive
I find the key that lets you slip inside
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door
But you know I think I recognize your face
But I've never seen you before
You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take
Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger"
I heard you say
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock 'n' Roll band
Who'll throw it all away
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger"
I heard you say, "at least not today"
I hitched a ride with my soul
By the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
Down memory lane
I never did find my way back
You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me
I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
The first thing I saw
As I walked through the door
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know
That I want you to know
What is written inside of your head
And time as it stands
Won't be held in my hands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky
I asked myself why
Can I never let anyone in?
I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
I hitched a ride with my soul
By the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
Down memory lane
I never did find my way back
You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me
I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
Some might say that sunshine follows thunder
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
Some might say that we should never ponder
On our thoughts today 'cause they will sway over time
Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day
'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
It was overflowing gently but it's all elementary my friend
Some might say they don't believe in heaven
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
Some might say you get what you've been given
If you don't get yours I won't get mine as well
Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day
'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
And my dog's been itching
Itching in the kitchen once again
Some might say (Some might say)
Some might say (Some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
Here's a thought for every man
Who tries to understand what is in his hands
He walks along the open road of love & life
Surviving if he can
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
Here's a thought for every man
Who tries to understand what is in his hands
He walks along the open road of love & life
Surviving if he can
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow [4x]
She's electric
She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I never expected
And I need more time
She's got a sister
And god only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time
And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying?
But I need more—
'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?
She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me
She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me
And I want you to know
Got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying?
But I need more—
'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
You need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
You need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Said well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
'Cause people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
'Cause people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
We were getting high [repeat until fade]
You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
'Cause in a car you can go far
Just depends what kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I met a funny looking girl
On a crowded beach in Spain
Her name was Avaline
She said she came to Spain to have a good time
But she was with her mum
Who had a face like a nun in pain
She said her name was Dot
She didn't half talk a lot
I couldn't tell if she was mad or not
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
On my polluted beach - with all my special friends
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
With my big house and my big car
And all my friend are there at the bar
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
'Cause in a car you can go far
It just depends what kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You know that feeling you get
You feel you're older than time
You ain't exactly sure
If you've been away a while
Do you keep the receipts
For the friends that you buy
And ain't it bittersweet
You were only just getting by
But I hope you know
That it won't let go
It sticks around with you until the day you die
And I hope you know that it's touch and go
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/f**in-in-the-bushes.html]
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong?
And until you've repaid
The dreams you bought for your lies
You'll be cast away
Alone under the stormy skies
But I hope you know
That it won't let go
It sticks around with you until the day you die
And I hope you know that it's touch and go
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong?
Found what I'd lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside
Thank you for the sun the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies & fears
I feel love
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/gas-panic.html]
I'm leaving all that I see
Now all my emotions fill the air I breath
Now you understand that this is not the promised land
They spoke of
There's nothing more to be
If you can be the remedy who heals love
Baby the time is right to tell it all like it is
And now that I feel god like there's nothing that can't be kissed
The name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain
He thought he was king creole
Until he found out, until he found out
He sits upon a throne
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/i-can-see-a-liar.html]
He lives a sleazy lie
But he's all alone again, again
I can see a liar, sitting by the fire
Trouble in his heart, laughing at the thought
Coming as he goes into overdose
I wonder what he thinks of me?
Little James, we're all the same
They always seem to look to us
But we weren't meant to be grown ups
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us
You live for your toys, even though they make noise
Have you ever played with plastercine
Or even tried a trampoline
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/little-james.html]
I'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
'Cos it won't be long before everyone is gone
Sailed out to sea, your mum you and me
You swam the ocean like a child
Life around us was so wild
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us
I'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
And it won't be long before everyone is gone
Found what i lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside
Thank you for the sun
The one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love
I'm leaving all that i see
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/put-yer-money-where-yer-mouth-is.html]
Now all my emotions fill the air i breathe
Now you understand that this is not the promised land they spoke of
There's nothing more to be if you can be the remedy who heals love
I thank you for the sun
The one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love
I thank you for the sun, the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love
Found what i lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside
Thank you for the sun
The one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies and fears
I feel love
I'm leaving all that i see
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/put-yer-money-where-yer-mouth-is.html]

Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer mamma sez that you was real
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer mamma sez that you was real
Ready or not, come what may
The bets are going down for judgement day
So put yer money in yer mouth
And your hands right upon the wheel
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/roll-it-over.html]
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer pappa sez that you was real
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer pappa sez that you was real
Ready or not, and come what may
You betcha going down on judgement day
So put yer money in yer mouth
And yer hands right upon the wheel
I can give a hundred million reasons
To build a barricade
I blame it on the changing of the seasons
The thoughts that I've conveyed
Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right
To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/sunday-morning-call.html]
Look around at all the plastic people
Who live without a care
Try to sit with me around my table
But never bring a chair
Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right
To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here
I can give a hundred million reasons
To build a barricade
I blame it on the changing of the seasons
The thoughts that I've conveyed
Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right
To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/sunday-morning-call.html]
Look around at all the plastic people
Who live without a care
Try to sit with me around my table
But never bring a chair
Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right
To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here
What tongueless ghost of sin crept through my curtains?
Sailing on a sea of sweat on a stormy night
I think he don't got a name but I can't be certain
And in me he starts to confide
That my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And if you hear me tap on your window
Better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way
My pulse pumps out a beat to the ghost dancer
My eyes are dead and my throat's like a black hole
And if there's a god would he give another chancer
An hour to sing for his soul
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/where-did-it-all-go-wrong.html]
Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on yer window
Yer better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way
Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on yer window
Then you get on your knees and you better pray
Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on your window
Yer better get on yer knees and pray
Panic is on the way
Panic is on the way
We put this festival on you bastards
With a lot of love
We worked for one year for you pigs
And you want to break our walls down
Or you want f**in' to destroy us
Well you go to hell
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
I love it
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/who-feels-love.html]
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, i love them
Fun, nice, life, youth, beautiful
I'm all for it
I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, i love them
Fun, nice, life, youth, beautiful
I'm all for it
Show me who you are
I'll show you what you love
I'll give you half the world if that's enough
Let me take you down
Let me hear you smile
Let me rest my head here for a while
In the end we'll leave it all behind
Because the life I think I'm trying to find
Is probably all in the mind
Show me who you are
I'll show you what you love
I'll give you all the world if that's enough
I wanna love you
I wanna be a better man
I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna see what's in your hands
Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I know you'll understand
That I know you'll understand
I wanna love you
I wanna be a better man
I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna see what's in your hands
Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That I know you'll understand
And I know you'll understand
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Oh
Born on a different cloud
from the ones that have burst round town
It's no surprise to me
that yer cla**less, clever and free...
Loaded just like the gun
You're the hero that's still unsung
Living on borrowed time
You're my sun and you're gonna shine
Talking to myself again
This time I think I'm getting through
It's funny how you think
It's funny when you do
Lonely soul
Busy working overtime
Nothing ever gets done
Specially when your hands are tied
Lonely soul
Baking up your mother's pride
Nothing ever gets done
Not until your war's won
Yeah I feel like the force of nature
could make you sing like a bird released
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure
you know it's buried beneath your feet
You know you look like faded picture
I see the cracks freezing on your skin
and as the world slowly turns and hits you
that the thieves of the night
are coming to take you in
For smoking all my stash
and burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
it's all over town that
the sun's going down
on the days of your easy life.
I bet you knew right away
you dope you don't know where it's at
It's all over town
that the sun's gone down
and it's high time to pray.
Yeah I feel like the force of nature
could make you sing like a bird released
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure
you know it's buried beneath your feet
You know you look like a faded picture
I see the cracks frozen on your skin
and as the world slowly turns and hits you
then the thieves of the night
are coming to take you in
For smoking all my stash
and burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
it's all over town that
the sun's going down
on the days of your easy life.
I bet you knew right away
you dope you don't know where it's at
It's all over if you're begging me please
then get on your knees and pray.
For smoking all my stash
and burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
it's all over town that
the sun's gone down
and it's high time to pray
I can go where I wanna
Be who I wanna be now
I can sleep under water
Never worried what I'm gonna dream now
Yeah the times come and gone
And I know where I'm from
And can be so...
It's hasta manana
You're on your own banana skin feet now
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
Had no sun over my face
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
For too long
I can say what I wanna
Feel how I wanna feel now
I can squeeze all the hours
I choose to devour with ease now
I can sing to the trees
Tarzan on harmonies for free yeah
You've been blocked and you're stalling
Nature is calling for me (you got me!)
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
Had no sun over my face
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
For too long
We the people fight for our existence
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance
Faded like the stars we wish to be
Y'know I didn't mean... what I just said
But my God woke up on the wrong side of His bed
And it just don't matter now
Little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of
As little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
Little by little you have to live it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask myself why are you really here?
True perfection has to be imperfect
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true
The day has come and now you'll have to accept
The life inside your head we gave to you
Oh when the sunshine beckons to ya
And your wings begin to unfold
the thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
are gonna keep me from the cold
And if the sword is among ya
and its words may wound my soul
you can fill me up with what you've got
cos my heart's been keeping old
She is love
and her ways are high and steep
She is love
and I believe her when she speaks.
Love
and her ways are high and steep
She is love
and I believe, I do believe her when she speaks.
You're in all my thoughts of pa**ion
And the dreams of my delight
Whatever stirs my mortal frame
will you keep it warm at night
I don't know where you come from
no I haven't got a clue
All I know is I'm in love
with someone who loves me too.
Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a past not far away
She's a little pirate in my mind
Singing songs of love to pa** the time
Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone
She's not anyone
A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night
Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone
She's not anyone
Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone
May your smile (may your smile)
Shine on (shine on)
Don't be scared (don't be scared)
Your destiny may keep you warm
Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Get up (get up)
Come on (come on)
Why're you scared? (I'm not scared)
You'll never change
What's been and gone
Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
We're all of us stars
We're fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see us some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
I get up - when I'm down
I can't swim - but my soul won't drown
I do believe - I got flare
I got speed and I walk on air
Cos God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll (babe)
Cos God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll (babe)
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain, runnin' through my veins
Cos you're my sunshine you're my rain
There's a light - that shines on
Shines - on - me - and it keeps me warm
It gimme peace - I must say
I can't sleep - cos the world won't wait
Step off the train all alone at dawn
Back into the hole where I was born
The sun in the sky never raised an eye to me
The blood on the trax and must be mine
The fool on the hill and I feel fine
Don't look back cos you know what you might see
Look into the wall of my mind's eye
I think I know, but I don't know why
The questions are the answers you might need
Coming in a mess going out in style
I ain't good-looking but I'm someone's child
No-one can give me the air that's mine to breathe
I met my maker
I made him cry
And on my shoulder he asked me why
His people won't fly through the storm
I said "Listen up man, they don't even know you're born"
All my people right here, right now
D'You Know What I Mean?
All my people right here, right now
D'You Know What I Mean?
All my people right here, right now
D'You Know What I Mean?
Yeah, yeah
I don't really care for what you believe
So open up your fist or you won't receive
The thoughts and the words of every man you'll need
Get up off the floor and believe in life
No-one's ever gonna ever ask you twice
Get on the bus and bring it on home to me
Everybody knows ... but no-one's saying nothing
And it's a sound so very loud ... that no-one can hear
I got something in my shoe ... it's keeping me from walking
Down the long and winding road ... back home to you
Around this town you've ceased to be
That's what you get for sleeping with the enemy
Where angels fly you won't play
So guess who's gonna take the blame for ...
My big mouth, my big name
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking
Slowly down the hall of fame?
Into my big mouth you could fly a plane
Who'll put on my shoes while they're walking
Slowly down the hall of fame?
Slowly down the hall of fame
I ain't never spoke to God
And I ain't never been to heaven
But you assumed I knew the way
Even though the map was given
And as you look into the eyes
Of a bloody cold assasin
Only then you'll realize
With who's life you have been messin'
An extraordinary guy
Can never have an ordinary day,
He might live a long goodbye
But that is not for me to say
I dig his friends, I dig his shoes
But he is just a child with nothing to lose
But his mind
They are sleeping while they dream
And then they want to be adored
They who don't say what they mean
Will live and die by their own sword.
I dig their friends, I dig their shoes
But they are like a child with nothing to lose
In their minds, their minds.
But I'll have my way
In my own time
I'll have my say
My star will shine
Cos you see me I got my Magic Pie
Think of me yeah that was me I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone.
There are but a thousand days preparing for a thousand years
Many minds to educate and people who have disappeared
D'you dig my friends? D'you dig my shoes?
I am like a child with nothing to lose but my mind
My mind
Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn.
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new.
Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away
Times are hard when things have got no meaning
I've found a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not believe in the things we find behind the door
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new.
Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away
Stand by me
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows, yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
If you're leaving will you take me with you
I'm tired of talking on my phone
There is one thing I can never give you
My heart will never be your home
So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new.
Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away
Stand by me
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows, yeah, nobody knows the way it's gonna be
The way it's gonna be, yeah
Maybe I can see, yeah.
Don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away
Hey, hey
Stand by me
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Stand by me
Nobody knows. Yeah, God only knows the way it's gonna be
They're trying hard to put me in my place
And that is why I've gotta keep running
The future is mine and it's no disgrace
Cos in the end the past means nothing
You tell me I'm free then you tie me down
And from my chains I think it's a pity
What did it cost you to wear my crown
You dont like me why don't you admit it
D'you feel a little down today?
Bet you ain't got much to say?
But your gonna miss me when I'm not there
You know I dont care, You know I dont care
As we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss and this
I Hope, I Think, I Know
And if I hear the names you call
If I stumble catch me when I fall
Cos baby after all, You'll never forget my name
If I may be so bold could I just say something
Come and make me my day
The clouds around your soul
Don't gather there for nothing
But I can chase them all away
Why d'you need a reason for to feel happy
Or be shining for the rest of the world
Give me just a smile and would you make it snappy
Get your shit together girl
You got a feeling lost inside
It just won't let you go
Your life is sneaking up behind
It just won't let you go
No it just won't let you go
Is what I'm trying to say...
Is would you maybe, come dancing with me
Cos to me it doesn't matter
If your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something you make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth
She knows exactly what she's worth to me!
That I can see, I can see
If you ever find yourself inside a bubble
You've gotta make your own way home
You can call me anytime you're seeing double
Now you know you're not alone
You got a feeling lost inside
It just won't let you go
Your life is sneaking up behind
It just won't let you go
No it just won't let you go
Is what I'm trying to say...
Is would you maybe, come dancing with me
Cos to me it doesn't matter if your hopes and dreams are shattered
When you say something you make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth
Maybe she'll come dancing with me
Cos to me it doesn't matter
If her hopes and dreams are shattered
When she says something
She'll make me believe
In the girl who wears a dirty shirt
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
She knows exactly what she's worth to me
Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
Now I see
Get on the rollercoaster
The fair's in town today
Y'gotta be bad-enough to beat the brave
So get on the helter skelter
Bowl into the fray
Y'gotta be bad-enough to beat the brave
You fade in-out
You fade in-out
Without a doubt
I don't see no shine
Today is just a daydream
Tomorrow we'll be castaway
Coming in-out of nowhere
Singin' rhapsody
Y'gotta be bad-enough to wanna be
Sitting upside a high chair
With the devils refugee
Is gonna be blinded by the light
That follows me
She fade in-out
She fade in-out
Without a doubt
I don't see no shine
Today is just a daydream
Tomorrow she'll be castaway
Cold and frosty morning
There's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
And as the day was dawning
My plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind
I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Damn my situation
And the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education
I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind
I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Me and you: what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right
So don't go away
Wash your face in the morning sun
Flash your pen at the song that I'm singing
Touchdown bass living on the run
Make no sweat at the hole that you're digging
Wrap up cold when it's warm outside
Your shit jokes remind me of Digsy's
Be my magic carpet ride
Fly me down to capital city in the sun
Kicking up a storm from the day that I was born
Sing a song for me one from 'Let It Be'
Open up your eyes get a grip on yourself inside
It's a bit early in the midnight hour for me
To go through all the things that I wanna be
I don't believe in everything I see
You know I'm blind so why d'you disagree
Take me away
'Cause I just don't want to stay
All the lies you make me say
Are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days
But they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by
All around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
All around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
You know it's gonna be OK
What you gonna do when the walls come falling down?
You never move you never make a sound
Where you gonna swim with the ridges that you found?
If you're lost at sea well I hope that you drown
Take me away
'Cause I just don't want to stay
All the lies you make me say
Are getting deeper every day
These are crazy days
But they make me shine
Time keeps rolling by
All around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
And all around the world
Gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
You know it's gonna be OK
All around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
'Cause all around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
You know it's gonna be OK
'Cause all around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
And all around the world
You gotta spread the word
Tell 'em what you heard
You know it's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK
It's gonna be OK

All around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell them what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
'Cause all around the world
You've gotta spread the word
Tell them what you heard
You know it's gonna be OK
All around the world

Tell them what you heard
We're gonna make a better day
All around the world

What I know, what I know
Yeah I know what I know
It's gonna be OK
I don't know what I know
What I know, what I know
Yeah I know what I know
It's gonna be OK
Yeah I know what I know

Pig's don't fly
Never say die
So please don't cry
Never say die
Please don't cry
Never say die
So please don't cry
Never say die
So please don't cry
Never say die
So please don't cry
Never say die
So please don't cry
Never say die
Say Something shout it from the roof tops off your head
Make it sort of mean something make me understand or I'll forget
The people here on life's beaches they wish upon the waves that hide the sand
Let them know that life teaches you to build a castle in the hand
Maybe the songs that we sing are wrong
Maybe the dreams that we dream are gone
So bring it on home and it wont be long
It's getting better man!
Hey! What was that you said to me?
Just say the word and I'd be free?
And where the stars are shining bright
It's getting better man!
And crashing in upon a wave
It's calling out beyond the grave
And We're the fire in the sky
We're getting better man!
Build something build a better place and call it home
Even if it means nothing you'll never-ever feel that you're alone
Gold and silver and sunshine is rising up
Pour yourself another cup of Lady Grey
Take my hand in the meantime, when you've had enough
You'll find me on the end of a runway, babe
Tell the world that you love them in a melody
Send my old piano and a telegram
Gotta get me a doctor with a remedy
I'm gonna talk a walk with the Monkey Man!
Someone tell me I'm dreaming
The freaks are rising up through the floor
Everything I believe in
Is telling me that I want more, more, more
Lay your love on the fire when you come on in
I got my hee-bee-jee-bees in a hidden bag
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up, high
Someone tell me I'm dreaming
The freaks are rising up through the floor
Everything I believe in
Is telling me that I want more, more, more
Lay your love on the fire when you come on in
I got my hee-bee-jee-bees in a hidden bag
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up, high
Shine a light on your fire when you come on in
I got my hee-bee-jee-bees in a hidden bag
Tell me what you desire and we'll bag it up, high
Eyes over the city
rise up from your soul
They hang over the streets at night
Brought on by the cold
We live with the numbers
Mining a dream for the same old song
What hope for the turning
If everything you know is wrong
So come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Be the fallen angel by my side
If you carry the lantern
I'll carry you home
You search for the disappeared
I'll bury the cold
Yours is a messiah
Mine is a dream and it won't be long
No hope for the journey
If no-one ever sees the dawn
So come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Will you be by my side?
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Be the fallen angel by my side
So come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Will you be by my side?
Hey come on, shake your rag doll, baby
Before you change your mind
Then come on, when the rapture takes me
Be the fallen angel by my side
I still don't know what I was waiting for
A big love to fall down from the sky
She took my hand and picked me up off the floor
She put an apple in my eye
I said I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Come feed me and then bring me down
She come up to me
I can't remember what she said
Cause I was in a trance and I forgot it all
I bet you don't know about all that
Revolution in her head
She make a lover seem so magical
She said I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Well heaven must of sent you
To save me from the rapture... yeah
I'm tired
Come get me off the merry-go-round
I'm wired
Come feed me and then bring me down
I'm all over my heart's desire,
I feel cold but I'm back in the fire,
Out of control but I'm tied up tight,
Come in, come out tonight.
I'm comin' up in the early morning,
I feel love in the shock of the lightning,
I fall into the blinding light,
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight.
Love is a time machine,
Up on the silver screen,
It's all in my mind,
Love is a litany,
A magical mystery,
And all in good time, and all in good time,
And all in good time.
I got my feet on the street but I can't stop flyin',
My head's in the clouds but at least I'm tryin',
I'm out of control but I'm tied up tight,
Come in, come out tonight.
There's a hole in the ground into which I'm fallin',
So God speaks to the sound of the poundin',
I'm all into the blinding light,
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight..
Love is a time machine,
Up on the silver screen,
It's all in my mind,
Love is a litany,
A magical mystery,
And all in good time, and all in good time,
And all in good time.
It's all in my mind,
Love is a time machine,
Up on the silver screen,
And all in good time, and all in good time,
And all in good time.
Here's a song
It reminds me of when we were young
Looking back at all the things we've done
You gotta keep on keepin' on
Out to sea
It's the only place I honestly
Can get myself some peace of mind
You know it's getting hard to fly
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
'cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
'cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
'cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong
Guess I'm out of time
I'm out of time
I'm out of time
I'm out of time
I'm out of time
Get off your high horse Lady, I don't need a ride tonight
Get off your high horse lady, I don't need a ride tonight
Lay down
I hear your soul song singing from a fire in the sky
I hear your soul song singing from a fire in the sky
Rain down
Rain down
Get off your high horse lady, I don't need a ride tonight
Get off your high horse lady, I don't need a ride tonight
Lay down
Lay down
The summer sun, that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known
A dying scream makes no sound
Calling out to all that I've ever known
Here am I, lost and found
Calling out to all
We live a dying dream
If you know what I mean
All that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known
Catch the wheel that breaks a butterfly
Cry the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
I called Him up in and out of nowhere
I said if You won't save me, please don't waste my time
All that I've ever known
All that I've ever known
It's all that I've ever known
Catch the wheel that breaks a butterfly
Cry the rain that fills the ocean wide
I tried to talk with God to no avail
I called Him up in and out of nowhere
I said if You won't save me, please don't waste my time
The summer sun, that blows my mind
Is falling down on all that I've ever known
In time we'll kiss the world goodbye
Falling down on all that I've ever known
Is all that I've ever known
Day's turning to night
Pray for the light
Let me come through
Let me take you away over the line
Everyone falling
Everyone falling
Dreamers come crawling
Neighbours jump walling
Let me come through
Let me take you away over the line
And we're away to be where there's life
Shake the will to comply
Fears don't try me
Tears don't cry me
And we're away to be where there's life
When we come call out
Everything's sold out
TV just closed down
There's nothing on the news now
Fears don't try me
Tears don't cry me
We're away to be where there's life
Be where there's life
Dig out your soul, cos here we go
We gotta move, it's what we do
Let me come through
Let me take you away to be where there's life
To be where there's life
Take you over the light
Under the signs
In through locked doors to secret floors
Where we've lost 'em before
They got nothing on me anymore, they got nothing on you
I don't care what they say anymore, all I want is the truth
I don't feel
to unveil,
in my soul,
singled out
They got nothing on me anymore, they got nothing on you
I don't care what they say anymore, all I want is the truth
I don't feel
to unveil,
hear my sound,
singled out
watch my style,
pick a place,
what a smile
from your face
I don't feel
to unveil,
in my soul,
singled out
watch my style,
pick a place,
what a smile
from your face
Hey-e- Yeah-e-ey!
They got nothing on me anymore, they got nothing on you
I don't care what they say anymore, all I want is the truth
The nature of reality
Is pure subjective fantasy
Space and time and here and now
Are only in your mind
Machine of god and devil too
With no weapons just the truth
Belief does not existence make
It's only in your mind
The nature of reality
Is only in your mind
Hold the line
Friend of mine
Sing a song
Soldier on
Shine a light
For me tonight
Don't be long
Soldier on
La la la [x4]
Who's to say
That you were right
And I was wrong
Soldier on
Come the day
Come the night
I'll be gone
Soldier on
La la la [x4]
Soldier on [x12]
I can take 'em all
So I leave you with this thought
There is a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all
Do you hear me when I say
That I got to walk this way
There is a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all
And I will catch you when you fall
That is what I'm gonna do
And I will catch you if you call
That is what I'm gonna do
I can see for miles
And I can see you and your crimes
There is a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all
Do you hear me when I say
That I gotta walk this way
There is a fire in the sky
I don't need no alibi
See I believe in all
And I will catch you when you fall
That is what I'm gonna do
And I will catch you if you call
That is what I'm gonna do
I carry madness
Everywhere I go
Over a border
And back to the snow
So if you see me
And I look right through
You shouldn't take it
As a reflection of you
Come on, Turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone
Love one another
Love one another
The boys in the bubble
They wanna be free
And they got so blind
That they cannot see
But I'm not your keeper
I don't have the key
I got a piano
I can't find the C
Come on, Turn up the sun
Turn it up for everyone
Love one another
Love one another
I know you think you deserve an explanation on the meaning of life
But what you think that you heard slipped away at the back of your mind
You get your mucky fingers burnt
You get your truth or your lies you have learnt
And all your plastic believers they leave us and they won't return
Walk on
And when you look in the mirror and your tying all your buttons and bows
And as you face your disease you can squeeze into the emperor's clothes
You found your gun in a paperbag
You get your history from the union jack
And all your brothers and sisters have gone and they wont come back
Failed the life in the city
All the fonies that roam at night
When I've gone yeah you look like you missed me
So come along with me, don't ask why
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Calling on the stars to fall
And catch the silver sunlight in your hands
Come for me and set me free
Lift me up and take me where I stand
She believes in everything
and everyone and you and yours and mine
I waited for a thousand years
For you to come and blow me out my mind
Hey Lyla
The star's about to fall -
So what you say Lyla
The world around us makes me feel so small Lyla
If you can hear me call then I can say Lyla
Heaven help you catch me if I fall
She's the queen of all I've seen
And every song and city far and near
Heaven help me mademoiselle
She rings the bell for all the world to hear
I'm seeing
A whole other world in my mind
Girl I feel it
I'm breathing a love all the time
You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind
You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind
Am I reaching
The World that I want deep inside
Girl I mean it
Here hold the key to the shrine
You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind
You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind
(blowing my minddddd!!!!)
Nah nah nah
Yeah i'm seeing
A whole other world in my mind
Girl I feel it
I'm breathing a love all the time
You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind
You turn me on
Love's like a bomb
Blowing my mind
Yeah I'm seeing!
I sold my soul for the second time
Cos the man, he don't pay me
I begged my landlord for some more time
He said "Son, the bills waiting"
My best friend called me the other night
He said "Man, are you crazy?"
My girlfriend told me to get a life
She said "boy, you lazy"
But I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute
A mans got a limit
I cant get a life if my hearts not in it
I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute
A mans got a limit
I cant get a life if my hearts' not in it
I lost my faith in the summertime
Cos it don't stop raining
The sky all day's as black as night
But I'm not complaining
I begged my doctor for one more line
He said "Son, words fail me"
It ain't no place to be killing time
But I guess I'm just lazy
I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute
A mans got a limit
I cant get a life if my hearts' not in it
I gotta show you, man,
The meaning of soul
I'm taking on love tonight
Get outta my way, yeah, man,
I dig what you say
But that ain't enough, alright
I'm a different breed
I'm outta your league
I'm ten out of ten, all night
Get outta my way
I'm about to do what you say
And that ain't enough alright
Alright I see the love in your eyes
If it's alright
All night
Then I'll be your light
I gotta show you the meaning of soul
Now we'll take it all up tonight
Get outta my way
I wanna do what you say
And that ain't enough alright
I'm a different breed
I'm outta your league
I'm ten out of ten, all night
Get outta my way
I'm about to do what you say
And that ain't enough alright
All right I see the love in your eyes
And its all right, can I be your light
I gotta show you about the meaning of soul
Take it on up tonight
I could be your lover
You could be you mind
We go on forever
Till the end of time
You could be my best friend
Stay up all night long
You could be my railroad
We'd go on and on
Lets get along
There's nothing here to do
Lets go find a rainbow
I could be wrong but what am i to do
Guess god thinks I'm Abel
You could be my enemy
I guess there's still time
I get round to loving you
Is that such a crime?
Lets get along
There's nothing here to do
Lets go find a rainbow
I could be wrong but what am i to do
Guess god thinks I'm Abel
No one can break us
No one could take us
If they tried
No one can break us
No one could take us
If they tried
Come on over
Let's make it tonight
Suddenly I found that I lost my way in the city
Streets in the thousands all the colours bleed into one
Fall down heaven wont help me
Call out no one would hear
All of a sudden I lost my outta the city
Stand tall
Stand proud
Every beginning is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town
The names and the faces in the places they mean nothing to me
Cos all they can do to be part of the queue in this town
Fall down heaven wont help me
Call out no one will hear
People tomorrow they say "well I say what a pity"
Stand tall
Stand proud
Every beginning is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble just finding some soul in this town
Stand tall
Stand proud
Every beginning is breaking its promise
I'm having trouble just finding my soul in this town
Finding my soul in this town
Keep on trying
Four Seasons.. seconds flick and flash... I'm alone
A lonely scream provides the scene
It's no home
Every night I hear you scream,
But you don't say what you mean
This was my dream, but now my dream has flown
I'm at the crossroads waiting for a sign
My life is standing still, but I'm still alive
Every night I think I know
In the morning where did he go
The answers disappear when I open my eyes
I'm no stranger to this place
Where real life and dreams collide
And even though I fall from grace
I will keep the dream alive
A little space
A little time
See what it can do
A little faith
Peace of mind
See what passes through
The sun will shine on you again
A bell will ring inside your head
And all will be brand new
Come alive
Come on in
Something let you know
The worlds as wide
As your life is thin
So entertain your goals
The sun will shine on you again
A bell will ring inside your head
And all will be brand new
All will be brand new
I can tell you what you wanna hear
I've been there once before
You brought me through the empty nights
Sleepless on your floor
The sun will shine on you again
A bell will ring inside your head
And all will be brand new
All will be brand new
Who kicked a hole in the sky so the heavens would cry over me?
Who stole the soul from the sun in a world come undone at the seams?
Let there be love - Let there be love
I hope the weather is calm as you sail up your heavenly stream
Suspended clear in the sky are the words that we sing in our dreams
Let there be love - Let there be love - Let there be love - Let there be love
Come on baby blue
Shake up your tired eyes
The world is waiting for you
May all your dreaming fill the empty sky
But if it makes you happy
Keep on clapping
Just remember I'll be by your side
And if you don't let go, it's gonna pass you by
I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cause the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello
There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
It's good to be back
You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take
Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I'm gonna take me away and hide
I'm thinking of things that I just can't abide
I know the roads down which your life will drive
I find the key that lets you slip inside
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door
But you know I think I recognize your face
But I've never seen you before
You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take
I know the roads down which your life will drive
I find the key that lets you slip inside
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door
But you know I think I recognize your face
But I've never seen you before
You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take
Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away
So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger"
I heard you say
Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock 'n' Roll band
Who'll throw it all away
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say
So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger"
I heard you say, "at least not today"
I hitched a ride with my soul
By the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
Down memory lane
I never did find my way back
You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me
I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
The first thing I saw
As I walked through the door
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know
That I want you to know
What is written inside of your head
And time as it stands
Won't be held in my hands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky
I asked myself why
Can I never let anyone in?
I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
I hitched a ride with my soul
By the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
Down memory lane
I never did find my way back
You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me
I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
Some might say that sunshine follows thunder
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
Some might say that we should never ponder
On our thoughts today 'cause they will sway over time
Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day
'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
It was overflowing gently but it's all elementary my friend
Some might say they don't believe in heaven
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
Some might say you get what you've been given
If you don't get yours I won't get mine as well
Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day
'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
And my dog's been itching
Itching in the kitchen once again
Some might say (Some might say)
Some might say (Some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
Here's a thought for every man
Who tries to understand what is in his hands
He walks along the open road of love & life
Surviving if he can
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
Here's a thought for every man
Who tries to understand what is in his hands
He walks along the open road of love & life
Surviving if he can
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow [4x]
She's electric
She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I never expected
And I need more time
She's got a sister
And god only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time
And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying?
But I need more—
'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?
She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me
She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me
And I want you to know
Got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying?
But I need more—
'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
You need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see
Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
You need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Said well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky
Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
'Cause people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova
'Cause people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why
How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
We were getting high [repeat until fade]
You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
'Cause in a car you can go far
Just depends what kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I met a funny looking girl
On a crowded beach in Spain
Her name was Avaline
She said she came to Spain to have a good time
But she was with her mum
Who had a face like a nun in pain
She said her name was Dot
She didn't half talk a lot
I couldn't tell if she was mad or not
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
On my polluted beach - with all my special friends
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
With my big house and my big car
And all my friend are there at the bar
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
'Cause in a car you can go far
It just depends what kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
