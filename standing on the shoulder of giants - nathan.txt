You know that feeling you get
You feel you're older than time
You ain't exactly sure
If you've been away a while

Do you keep the receipts
For the friends that you buy
And ain't it bittersweet
You were only just getting by

But I hope you know
That it won't let go
It sticks around with you until the day you die
And I hope you know that it's touch and go
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/f**in-in-the-bushes.html]
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong?

And until you've repaid
The dreams you bought for your lies
You'll be cast away
Alone under the stormy skies

But I hope you know
That it won't let go
It sticks around with you until the day you die
And I hope you know that it's touch and go
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong?


Found what I'd lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside

Thank you for the sun the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies & fears
I feel love
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/gas-panic.html]

I'm leaving all that I see
Now all my emotions fill the air I breath

Now you understand that this is not the promised land
They spoke of
There's nothing more to be
If you can be the remedy who heals love




Baby the time is right to tell it all like it is
And now that I feel god like there's nothing that can't be kissed
The name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain
He thought he was king creole
Until he found out, until he found out

He sits upon a throne
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/i-can-see-a-liar.html]
He lives a sleazy lie
But he's all alone again, again

I can see a liar, sitting by the fire
Trouble in his heart, laughing at the thought
Coming as he goes into overdose
I wonder what he thinks of me?


Little James, we're all the same
They always seem to look to us
But we weren't meant to be grown ups
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us

You live for your toys, even though they make noise
Have you ever played with plastercine
Or even tried a trampoline
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/little-james.html]
I'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
'Cos it won't be long before everyone is gone


Sailed out to sea, your mum you and me
You swam the ocean like a child
Life around us was so wild
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us

I'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
And it won't be long before everyone is gone

Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer mamma sez that you was real
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer mamma sez that you was real

Ready or not, come what may
The bets are going down for judgement day
So put yer money in yer mouth
And your hands right upon the wheel

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/roll-it-over.html]
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer pappa sez that you was real
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer pappa sez that you was real

Ready or not, and come what may
You betcha going down on judgement day
So put yer money in yer mouth
And yer hands right upon the wheel



I can give a hundred million reasons
To build a barricade
I blame it on the changing of the seasons
The thoughts that I've conveyed

Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right

To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/sunday-morning-call.html]
Look around at all the plastic people
Who live without a care
Try to sit with me around my table
But never bring a chair

Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right

To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here


I can give a hundred million reasons
To build a barricade
I blame it on the changing of the seasons
The thoughts that I've conveyed

Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right

To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here

What tongueless ghost of sin crept through my curtains?
Sailing on a sea of sweat on a stormy night
I think he don't got a name but I can't be certain
And in me he starts to confide

That my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And if you hear me tap on your window
Better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way

My pulse pumps out a beat to the ghost dancer
My eyes are dead and my throat's like a black hole
And if there's a god would he give another chancer
An hour to sing for his soul

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/where-did-it-all-go-wrong.html]
Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on yer window
Yer better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way

Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on yer window
Then you get on your knees and you better pray
Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on your window
Yer better get on yer knees and pray
Panic is on the way
Panic is on the way



We put this festival on you bastards
With a lot of love
We worked for one year for you pigs
And you want to break our walls down
Or you want f**in' to destroy us
Well you go to hell

Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes

I love it

Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/who-feels-love.html]
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes

I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, i love them
Fun, nice, life, youth, beautiful
I'm all for it

I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, i love them
Fun, nice, life, youth, beautiful
I'm all for it
