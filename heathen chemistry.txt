Show me who you are
I'll show you what you love
I'll give you half the world if that's enough

Let me take you down
Let me hear you smile
Let me rest my head here for a while

In the end we'll leave it all behind
Because the life I think I'm trying to find
Is probably all in the mind

Show me who you are
I'll show you what you love
I'll give you all the world if that's enough



I wanna love you
I wanna be a better man
I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna see what's in your hands

Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I know you'll understand
That I know you'll understand

I wanna love you
I wanna be a better man
I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna see what's in your hands

Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That I know you'll understand
And I know you'll understand

I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man

Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Oh




Born on a different cloud
from the ones that have burst round town
It's no surprise to me
that yer cla**less, clever and free...

Loaded just like the gun
You're the hero that's still unsung
Living on borrowed time
You're my sun and you're gonna shine

Talking to myself again
This time I think I'm getting through
It's funny how you think
It's funny when you do

Lonely soul
Busy working overtime
Nothing ever gets done
Specially when your hands are tied

Lonely soul
Baking up your mother's pride
Nothing ever gets done
Not until your war's won



Yeah I feel like the force of nature
could make you sing like a bird released
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure
you know it's buried beneath your feet
You know you look like faded picture
I see the cracks freezing on your skin
and as the world slowly turns and hits you
that the thieves of the night
are coming to take you in

For smoking all my stash
and burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
it's all over town that
the sun's going down
on the days of your easy life.

I bet you knew right away
you dope you don't know where it's at
It's all over town
that the sun's gone down
and it's high time to pray.

Yeah I feel like the force of nature
could make you sing like a bird released
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure
you know it's buried beneath your feet
You know you look like a faded picture

the sun's going down
on the days of your easy life.

I bet you knew right away
you dope you don't know where it's at
It's all over if you're begging me please
then get on your knees and pray.

For smoking all my stash
and burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
it's all over town that
the sun's gone down
and it's high time to pray


I can go where I wanna
Be who I wanna be now
I can sleep under water
Never worried what I'm gonna dream now

Yeah the times come and gone
And I know where I'm from
And can be so...
It's hasta manana
You're on your own banana skin feet now

Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
Had no sun over my face
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
For too long

I can say what I wanna
Feel how I wanna feel now
I can squeeze all the hours
I choose to devour with ease now

I can sing to the trees
Tarzan on harmonies for free yeah
You've been blocked and you're stalling
Nature is calling for me (you got me!)

Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
Had no sun over my face
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
For too long


We the people fight for our existence
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance
Faded like the stars we wish to be

Y'know I didn't mean... what I just said
But my God woke up on the wrong side of His bed
And it just don't matter now

Little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of
As little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
Little by little you have to live it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask myself why are you really here?

True perfection has to be imperfect
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true
The day has come and now you'll have to accept
The life inside your head we gave to you


Oh when the sunshine beckons to ya
And your wings begin to unfold
the thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
are gonna keep me from the cold

And if the sword is among ya
and its words may wound my soul
you can fill me up with what you've got
cos my heart's been keeping old

She is love
and her ways are high and steep
She is love
and I believe her when she speaks.

Love
and her ways are high and steep
She is love
and I believe, I do believe her when she speaks.

You're in all my thoughts of pa**ion
And the dreams of my delight
Whatever stirs my mortal frame
will you keep it warm at night

I don't know where you come from
no I haven't got a clue
All I know is I'm in love
with someone who loves me too.


Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a past not far away
She's a little pirate in my mind
Singing songs of love to pa** the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone

May your smile (may your smile)
Shine on (shine on)
Don't be scared (don't be scared)
Your destiny may keep you warm

Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

Get up (get up)
Come on (come on)
Why're you scared? (I'm not scared)
You'll never change
What's been and gone

Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

We're all of us stars
We're fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see us some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out


I get up - when I'm down
I can't swim - but my soul won't drown
I do believe - I got flare
I got speed and I walk on air

Cos God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll (babe)
Cos God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll (babe)

And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it

In and out my brain, runnin' through my veins
Cos you're my sunshine you're my rain

There's a light - that shines on
Shines - on - me - and it keeps me warm
It gimme peace - I must say
I can't sleep - cos the world won't wait
