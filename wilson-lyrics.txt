I live my life in the city
There's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say it's just a waste of time
When they said I should feed my head
That to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
You're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you're concerned about the way I feel

Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star

I live my life in the city
There's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say it's just a waste of time
When they said I should feed my head
Well, that to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
You're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you're concerned about the way I feel

Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star

You're not down with who I am
Look at you now, you're all in my hands
Tonight

Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star

It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll

I'd like to be somebody else and not know where I've been
I'd like to build myself a house out of plasticine
Shake along with me
I've been driving in my car with my friend Mr. Soft
Mr. Clean and Mr. Ben are living in my loft
Shake along with me!

I'm sorry but I just don't know I know
I said I told you so
But when you're happy and you're feeling fine
Then you'll know it's the right time
It's the right time
To shake along with me!

Mister Sifter sold me songs
when I was just sixteen
Now he stops at traffic lights
but only when they're green

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I just wanna fly
Want to live I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I said, maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I will never be
All the things that I wanna be
Now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I just wanna fly
Want to live I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Gonna live forever [x6]

Hey you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly
Tell me how high
Do you think you'll go
Before you start falling
Hey you! Up in a tree
You wanna be me
But that couldn't be
Cos the people here they don't hear you calling
How does it feel
When you're inside me?

Hey you! wearing the crown
Making no sound
I heard you feel down
Well that's too bad
Welcome to my world
Hey you! Stealing the light
I heard that the shine's
Gone out of your life.
Well that's just too bad
Welcome to my world

You'll need assistance with the things that you have never ever seen
It's just a case of never breathing out
Before you've breathed it in
How does it feel
When you're inside me?

Hey you! Up in the sky
Learning to fly
Tell me how high Do you think you'll go

How does it feel

I need to be myself
I can't be no one else
I'm feeling supersonic
Give me gin and tonic
You can have it all but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your BMW ?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

You need to find out
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow

'Cos my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call [2x]

You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else
I know a girl called Elsa
She's into Alka Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffin' in her tissue
Sellin' the Big Issue

When she finds out
No one's gonna tell her what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you wanna say
But before tomorrow

'Cos my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call [2x]

What was that sound ringing around your brain?
Today was just a blur, you gotta head like a ghost train
What was that sound ringing around your brain?
You're here on your own who you gonna find to blame?

You're the outcast - you're the underclass
But you don't care - because you're living fast

You're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who
I'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight.

Bring it on down. Bring it down for me
Your head's in a fish tank
Your body and your mind can't breath

You're the outcast - you're the underclass
But you don't care - because you're living fast

You're the un-invited guest who stays 'till the end
I know you've got a problem that the devil sends
You think they're talking 'bout you but you don't know who
I'll be scraping your life from the soul of my shoe tonight.

Is it my imagination
Or have I finally found something worth living for?
I was looking for some action
But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol

You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
Cos when it comes on top . . .

You gotta make it happen!

Is it worth the aggravation
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?
It's a crazy situation
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol!

You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
Cos when it comes on top . . .

You gotta make it happen!

What a life it would be
If you would come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
And we'll have lasagne
I'll treat you like a Queen
I'll give you strawberries and cream
And then your friends will all go green
For my lasagne

These could be the best days of our lives
But I don't think we've been living very wise
Oh no! no!

What a life it would be
If you would come to mine for tea
I'll pick you up at half past three
And we'll have lasagne

These could be the best days of our lives

Oh no! no!

For my lasagne

Slide away - and give it all you've got
My today - fell in from the top
I dream of you - and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now?

Hold me down - all the world's asleep
I need you now - you've knocked me off my feet
I dream of you - and we talk of growing old
But you said please don't!

Slide in baby - together we'll fly
I've tried praying - but I don't know what you're saying to me

Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning, we don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done

Let me be the one that shines with you
And we can slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Away

Slide away - give it all you've got
My today - fell in from the top
I dream of you - and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now?

Slide in baby - together we'll fly
I've tried praying - and I know just what you're saying to me

Now that you're mine
We'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one who shines with you
In the morning we don't know what to do
We're two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done
Oh let me be the one, that shines with you
And we can slide away

Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away
Slide away

I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there

I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there

I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there

I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there

I don't know
I don't care
All I know is you can take me there

Take me there
All I know is you can take me there

Take me there

Slide away
Slide away

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye I'm going home

I hate the way that even though you
Know you're wrong you say you're right
I hate the books you read and all your friends
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night
Up all night

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye I'm going home

I hate the way that you are so sarcastic
And you're not very bright
You think that everything you've done's fantastic
Your music's shite it keeps me up all night
Up all night

And it will be nice to be alone
For a week or two
But I know that I will be right
Right back here with you
With you...

There's no need for you to say you're sorry
Goodbye I'm going home
I don't care no more so don't you worry
Goodbye I'm going home

Sing a sad song
In a lonely place
Try to put a word in for me
It's been so long
Since I found this place
You better put in two or three
We as people, are just walking 'round
Our heads are firmly fixed in the ground
What we don't see
Well it can't be real
What we don't touch we cannot feel

Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
And we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong
So we don't ask why
Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away
We're throwing it all away at the end of the day

If you need it
Something I can give
I know I'd help you if I can
If your honest and you say that you did
You know that I would give you my hand
Or a sad song
In a lonely place
I'll try to put a word in for you
Need a shoulder? well if that's the case
You know there's nothing I wouldn't do

Where we're living in this town
The sun is coming up and it's going down
But it's all just the same at the end of the day
When we cheat and we lie
Nobody says it's wrong
So we don't ask why
Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day

Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Don't throw it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away

Throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
You're throwing it all away at the end of the day

I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the nights will throw you away
'Cause the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
'Cause the years are falling by like the rain
It's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello

Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
It's good to be back

You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take

Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me

I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I'm gonna take me away and hide
I'm thinking of things that I just can't abide

I know the roads down which your life will drive
I find the key that lets you slip inside
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door
But you know I think I recognize your face
But I've never seen you before

You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take

I know the roads down which your life will drive
I find the key that lets you slip inside
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door
But you know I think I recognize your face
But I've never seen you before

You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take

Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me

I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

I said maybe (I said maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (saves me)

Slip inside the eye of your mind
Don't you know you might find
A better place to play
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger"
I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a Rock 'n' Roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace, take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say

So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say

So, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
My soul slides away
"But don't look back in anger, don't look back in anger"
I heard you say, "at least not today"

I hitched a ride with my soul
By the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
Down memory lane
I never did find my way back

You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!

Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame

The first thing I saw
As I walked through the door
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know
That I want you to know
What is written inside of your head

And time as it stands
Won't be held in my hands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky
I asked myself why
Can I never let anyone in?

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!

Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame

I hitched a ride with my soul
By the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
Down memory lane
I never did find my way back

You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!

Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame


Some might say that sunshine follows thunder
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
Some might say that we should never ponder
On our thoughts today 'cause they will sway over time

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
It was overflowing gently but it's all elementary my friend

Some might say they don't believe in heaven
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
Some might say you get what you've been given
If you don't get yours I won't get mine as well

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
And my dog's been itching
Itching in the kitchen once again

Some might say (Some might say)
Some might say (Some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)
You know what some might say (You know what some might say)

Here's a thought for every man
Who tries to understand what is in his hands
He walks along the open road of love & life
Surviving if he can

Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow

As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride

As he faced the sun he cast no shadow

Here's a thought for every man
Who tries to understand what is in his hands
He walks along the open road of love & life
Surviving if he can

Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
Chained to all the places that he never wished to stay
Bound with all the weight of all the words he tried to say
As he faced the sun he cast no shadow

As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride
As they took his soul they stole his pride

As he faced the sun he cast no shadow [4x]

She's electric
She's in a family full of eccentrics
She's done things I never expected
And I need more time
She's got a sister
And god only knows how I've missed her
And on the palm of her hand is a blister
And I need more time

And I want you to know
I've got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying?
But I need more—
'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?

She's got a brother
We don't get on with one another
But I quite fancy her mother
And I think that she likes me
She's got a cousin
In fact she's got 'bout a dozen
She's got one in the oven
But it's nothing to do with me

And I want you to know
Got my mind made up now
But I need more time
And I want you to say
Do you know what I'm saying?
But I need more—
'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me
There's lots and lots for us to see
There's lots and lots for us to do
She is electric, can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?
Can I be electric too?

All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see

Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon

Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well

What's the story morning glory?
Well
You need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up

All your dreams are made
When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade
Today's the day that all the world will see

Another sunny afternoon
Walking to the sound of my favorite tune
Tomorrow never knows what it doesn't know too soon

Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Need a little time to wake up
Need a little time to rest your mind
You know you should so I guess you might as well

What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
You need a little time to wake up, wake up

Well
What's the story morning glory?
Well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up
Well
What's the story morning glory?
Said well
Need a little time to wake up, wake up


How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?

Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova in the sky

Wake up the dawn and ask her why
A dreamer dreams she never dies
Wipe that tear away now from your eye
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?

Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova

'Cause people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why

How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
Slowly walking down the hall
Faster than a cannon ball
Where were you while we were getting high?

Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova in the sky
Some day you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide
In a champagne supernova
A champagne supernova

'Cause people believe that they're
Gonna get away for the summer
But you and I, we live and die
The world's still spinning round
We don't know why
Why, why, why, why

How many special people change
How many lives are living strange
Where were you while we were getting high?
We were getting high [repeat until fade]

You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
'Cause in a car you can go far
Just depends what kind of car you are

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I met a funny looking girl
On a crowded beach in Spain
Her name was Avaline
She said she came to Spain to have a good time
But she was with her mum
Who had a face like a nun in pain
She said her name was Dot
She didn't half talk a lot
I couldn't tell if she was mad or not

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
On my polluted beach - with all my special friends
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England
With my big house and my big car
And all my friend are there at the bar

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You know I need a little break
To get away for a holiday
So I can see the sun
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun
If you get some
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane
Or I could steal a car
'Cause in a car you can go far
It just depends what kind of car you are

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
What kind of car you are
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You know that feeling you get
You feel you're older than time
You ain't exactly sure
If you've been away a while

Do you keep the receipts
For the friends that you buy
And ain't it bittersweet
You were only just getting by

But I hope you know
That it won't let go
It sticks around with you until the day you die
And I hope you know that it's touch and go
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/f**in-in-the-bushes.html]
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong?

And until you've repaid
The dreams you bought for your lies
You'll be cast away
Alone under the stormy skies

But I hope you know
That it won't let go
It sticks around with you until the day you die
And I hope you know that it's touch and go
I hope the tears don't stain the world that waits outside
Where did it all go wrong?


Found what I'd lost inside
My spirit has been purified
Take a thorn from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside

Thank you for the sun the one that shines on everyone
Who feels love
Now there's a million years between my fantasies & fears
I feel love
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/gas-panic.html]

I'm leaving all that I see
Now all my emotions fill the air I breath

Now you understand that this is not the promised land
They spoke of
There's nothing more to be
If you can be the remedy who heals love




Baby the time is right to tell it all like it is
And now that I feel god like there's nothing that can't be kissed
The name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain
He thought he was king creole
Until he found out, until he found out

He sits upon a throne
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/i-can-see-a-liar.html]
He lives a sleazy lie
But he's all alone again, again

I can see a liar, sitting by the fire
Trouble in his heart, laughing at the thought
Coming as he goes into overdose
I wonder what he thinks of me?


Little James, we're all the same
They always seem to look to us
But we weren't meant to be grown ups
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us

You live for your toys, even though they make noise
Have you ever played with plastercine
Or even tried a trampoline
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/little-james.html]
I'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
'Cos it won't be long before everyone is gone


Sailed out to sea, your mum you and me
You swam the ocean like a child
Life around us was so wild
Thank you for your smile
You make it all worthwhile to us

I'm singing this song for you and your mum that's all
And it won't be long before everyone is gone

Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer mamma sez that you was real
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer mamma sez that you was real

Ready or not, come what may
The bets are going down for judgement day
So put yer money in yer mouth
And your hands right upon the wheel

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/roll-it-over.html]
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer pappa sez that you was real
Put yer money where yer mouth is
Yer pappa sez that you was real

Ready or not, and come what may
You betcha going down on judgement day
So put yer money in yer mouth
And yer hands right upon the wheel



I can give a hundred million reasons
To build a barricade
I blame it on the changing of the seasons
The thoughts that I've conveyed

Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right

To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/sunday-morning-call.html]
Look around at all the plastic people
Who live without a care
Try to sit with me around my table
But never bring a chair

Does it make it all right?
It doesn't make it all right

To roll it over my soul and leave me here
Roll it over my soul and leave me here


I can give a hundred million reasons
To build a barricade
I blame it on the changing of the seasons
The thoughts that I've conveyed

Does it make it all right?

Roll it over my soul and leave me here

What tongueless ghost of sin crept through my curtains?
Sailing on a sea of sweat on a stormy night
I think he don't got a name but I can't be certain
And in me he starts to confide

That my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And if you hear me tap on your window
Better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way

My pulse pumps out a beat to the ghost dancer
My eyes are dead and my throat's like a black hole
And if there's a god would he give another chancer
An hour to sing for his soul

[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/where-did-it-all-go-wrong.html]
Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on yer window
Yer better get on yer knees and pray panic is on the way

Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on yer window
Then you get on your knees and you better pray
Cos my family don't seem so familiar
And my enemies all know my name
And when you hear me tap on your window
Yer better get on yer knees and pray
Panic is on the way
Panic is on the way



We put this festival on you bastards
With a lot of love
We worked for one year for you pigs
And you want to break our walls down
Or you want f**in' to destroy us
Well you go to hell

Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes

I love it

Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oasis/standing-on-the-shoulder-of-giants/who-feels-love.html]
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes
Kids are running around naked f**in' in the bushes

I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, i love them
Fun, nice, life, youth, beautiful
I'm all for it

I love it
Room for everybody here
Yes, all are welcome
Yes indeed, i love them
Fun, nice, life, youth, beautiful
I'm all for it

Show me who you are
I'll show you what you love
I'll give you half the world if that's enough

Let me take you down
Let me hear you smile
Let me rest my head here for a while

In the end we'll leave it all behind
Because the life I think I'm trying to find
Is probably all in the mind

Show me who you are
I'll show you what you love
I'll give you all the world if that's enough



I wanna love you
I wanna be a better man
I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna see what's in your hands

Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And I know you'll understand
That I know you'll understand

I wanna love you
I wanna be a better man
I don't wanna hurt you
I just wanna see what's in your hands

Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, alright now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That I know you'll understand
And I know you'll understand

I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man
I'm gonna be a better man, I'm gonna be a better man

Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Oh




Born on a different cloud
from the ones that have burst round town
It's no surprise to me
that yer cla**less, clever and free...

Loaded just like the gun
You're the hero that's still unsung
Living on borrowed time
You're my sun and you're gonna shine

Talking to myself again
This time I think I'm getting through
It's funny how you think
It's funny when you do

Lonely soul
Busy working overtime
Nothing ever gets done
Specially when your hands are tied

Lonely soul
Baking up your mother's pride
Nothing ever gets done
Not until your war's won



Yeah I feel like the force of nature
could make you sing like a bird released
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure
you know it's buried beneath your feet
You know you look like faded picture
I see the cracks freezing on your skin
and as the world slowly turns and hits you
that the thieves of the night
are coming to take you in

For smoking all my stash
and burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
it's all over town that
the sun's going down
on the days of your easy life.

I bet you knew right away
you dope you don't know where it's at
It's all over town
that the sun's gone down
and it's high time to pray.

Yeah I feel like the force of nature

and as the world slowly turns and hits you
then the thieves of the night

the sun's going down
on the days of your easy life.

I bet you knew right away
you dope you don't know where it's at
It's all over if you're begging me please
then get on your knees and pray.

For smoking all my stash
and burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
it's all over town that
the sun's gone down
and it's high time to pray


I can go where I wanna
Be who I wanna be now
I can sleep under water
Never worried what I'm gonna dream now

Yeah the times come and gone
And I know where I'm from
And can be so...
It's hasta manana
You're on your own banana skin feet now

Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
Had no sun over my face
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
For too long

I can say what I wanna
Feel how I wanna feel now
I can squeeze all the hours
I choose to devour with ease now

I can sing to the trees
Tarzan on harmonies for free yeah
You've been blocked and you're stalling
Nature is calling for me (you got me!)

Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
Had no sun over my face
Yeah I've been hung in a bad place
For too long


We the people fight for our existence
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance
Faded like the stars we wish to be

Y'know I didn't mean... what I just said
But my God woke up on the wrong side of His bed
And it just don't matter now

Little by little we gave you everything you ever dreamed of
As little by little the wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
Little by little you have to live it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask myself why are you really here?

True perfection has to be imperfect
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true
The day has come and now you'll have to accept
The life inside your head we gave to you


Oh when the sunshine beckons to ya
And your wings begin to unfold
the thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
are gonna keep me from the cold

And if the sword is among ya
and its words may wound my soul
you can fill me up with what you've got
cos my heart's been keeping old

She is love
and her ways are high and steep
She is love
and I believe her when she speaks.

Love
and her ways are high and steep
She is love
and I believe, I do believe her when she speaks.

You're in all my thoughts of pa**ion
And the dreams of my delight
Whatever stirs my mortal frame
will you keep it warm at night

I don't know where you come from
no I haven't got a clue
All I know is I'm in love
with someone who loves me too.


Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a past not far away
She's a little pirate in my mind
Singing songs of love to pa** the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone

Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone

May your smile (may your smile)
Shine on (shine on)
Don't be scared (don't be scared)
Your destiny may keep you warm

Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

Get up (get up)
Come on (come on)
Why're you scared? (I'm not scared)
You'll never change
What's been and gone

Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

We're all of us stars
We're fading away
Just try not to worry
You'll see us some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out


I get up - when I'm down
I can't swim - but my soul won't drown
I do believe - I got flare
I got speed and I walk on air

Cos God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll (babe)
Cos God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll (babe)

And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it

In and out my brain, runnin' through my veins
Cos you're my sunshine you're my rain

There's a light - that shines on
Shines - on - me - and it keeps me warm
It gimme peace - I must say
I can't sleep - cos the world won't wait
